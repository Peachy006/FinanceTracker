# Running the project
To run this project you will need to tab into the frontend folder in the root directory and run npm dev.

When running the project just through the IDE it will open on port 8080 and 
will fail since the backend is not meant to be displayed without the react-app.

When running the project through the terminal it will open on port 3000.

Chances are that if you are on windows you will need gitbash

If you are running the project properly you will need to run the database first through XAMPP for now.
I am sorry it is like this i will fix it later on in the process.
In XAMPP you just run the apache and mysql services, and the project should run.
